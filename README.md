👋 Hi, I’m Anton. 

🧡 I always was passionate by mathematics and building innovative software. The discovery of Computer Science and Software Engineering was an immediate crush, I could finally build things with no more tools than a computer while exercising my logic-driven mind. Since then I have been working on acquiring news skills through a lot of personal projects (some of which you can find on there!) and fantastic team adventures.

📍I'm a Computer Science and Management student at King's College London. Since this summer, I also have the honnor of serving as the founder and principal of King's Labs, the new software engineering society at King's!

💻I love learning new languages and technlogies but I mostly code in Java, JavaScript, Python, NodeJS, and Scala.

⭐️Always looking for exciting projects to work on, so feel free to reach out @ absirgue@gmail.com!
