👋 Hi, I’m Anton. 

🧡 I always was passionate by mathematics and building innovative software. The discovery of Computer Science and Software Engineering was an immediate crush, I could finally build things with no more tools than a computer while exercising my logic-driven mind. Since then I have been working on acquiring news skills through a lot of personal projects (some of which you can find on there!) and fantastic team adventures.

📍I'm a Computer Science and Management student at King's College London. Since this summer, I also have the honnor of serving as the founder and principal of King's Labs, the new software engineering society at King's!

💻I love learning new languages and technlogies but I mostly code in Java, JavaScript, Python, NodeJS, and Scala.

🚀I am on a quest to get my hands as dirty with AI as possible. Look out for captivating learning trails (such as with Andrej Karpathy's,ex head of AI at Tesla, YoTube tutorials) and exciting projects to put my new skills in practice. Always looking for some constructive feedback, so very happy to chat @ absirgue@gmail.com!
